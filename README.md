# Barnes–Hut N-body simulation

[View Here](https://tylerwbell.github.io/nbody/)

[N-body simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation) using the [Barnes-Hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes–Hut_simulation) algorithm in javascript.

You can configure some options in [main.js](https://tylerwbell.github.io/nbody/main.js).

- `drawVelocity`: draw a vector to represent the velocity of each point
- `renderBodies`: render points with a circle proportional to the mass of each point
- `useBarnesHut`: set to false to compare performance with a direct sum algorithm
